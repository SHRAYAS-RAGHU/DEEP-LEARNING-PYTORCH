# MODEL 
- PRETRAINED MODEL HAS BEEN INCLUDED TO DIRECTLY TEST THE IMAGES - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QDCsum1VqDyj3PZUrkdy4-daZ_M-Pu_X/view?usp=sharing

# TESTING :
Model is tested with images from the given dataset that have not been used for training. Those Images are included above. 

For verifying robustness of the model, a random Short axis Cardiac MRI image was taken from the 
internet and it was segmented. visual results appear to be appealing.

With further more of training with various datasets and parameter optimisation the model can be made even accurate.

# USAGE :
- Download the dataset and the model file to ur local computer and paste the test.py file in the same folder and run the file.
- If u wish to modify the architecture or optimize the parameters and train it use the colab file single_class_segmentation.ipynb
